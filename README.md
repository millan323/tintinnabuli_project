# Tintinnabuli Harmonizer

A Python-based tool that generates harmonic voices based on Arvo PÃ¤rt's tintinnabuli composition technique.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Input a melody note or short melody
- Output one or more harmony notes based on tintinnabuli rules
- Support various harmonic strategies (e.g., parallel major 6ths, triad-based proximity)
- Enable musical transformations (e.g., reversal, reflection)

## ðŸ§  Concept

This tool is inspired by Arvo PÃ¤rt's **tintinnabuli** style, which builds harmony lines that are closely tied to a central triad. It uses algorithmic logic to simulate this technique, helping composers and students explore minimalist composition methods.

## âœ… Current Features

- Generate tintinnabuli harmonies from a melody
- Support for simple melody input
- Melody transformations: reverse, reflect

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon

- MIDI input/output
- GUI for interactive exploration
- Multiple harmonic "modes" (e.g., M-voice vs T-voice)
- Polyphonic input handling

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x

## ðŸ›  How to Run

```bash
python tintinnabuli_harmonizer.py
