# ⏭️ Work Resumption Checklist – Segment 2 (Stufen)

## 1. Canon Rhythm Analysis
- [ ] Identify entry rhythm and offset for each `m` voice (e.g. 16th note, quarter, syncopation)
- [ ] Notate any rhythm staggering or entrances
- [ ] Confirm any overlapping or layering rules

## 2. Add `m2` Voice (–6 semitones)
- [ ] Add `m2` notes to all `m` parts
- [ ] Review for register balance (adjust octave if needed)

## 3. Tintinnabuli Layering (First Pass)
- [ ] Begin `Ta1` layer (–1 scale degree, extended duration)
- [ ] Sketch logic for `Tb2` (syncopated 0.25 rhythm from house)

## 4. Optional Tasks
- [ ] Review structure of Segment 2 for clarity
- [ ] Cross-reference Segment 1 for consistency
